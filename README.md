# wondrousWebWorks()

Thank you for viewing my project. wondrousWebWorks() is a profile for me as a full stack developer, including some information about me, skills, experience, acontact section and a portfolio. It also includes an admin page, where the site owner can manage the site and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.
