I hail from a land far far away, but my work and passion for developing is no fairy tale. Unless of course it's too good to be true.  It IS true by the way... I'm a husband and a father and based on feedback and a few printed mugs, I'm in actual fact the reigning best father in the world for the third year running! Let it suffice to say that all the good qualities you expect to find in a model worker apply to me as well. I'd like to highlight a few I think might be of interest to you.</p>
